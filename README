Explanation:

    Color Detection:
        The function detect_sign converts the frame to HSV color space and creates masks to detect the red color. Adjust the lower_red and upper_red ranges for different signs/colors.

    Contour Detection:
        Find contours in the mask and assume the largest contour corresponds to the sign.

    Bounding Box and Centroid:
        Draw the bounding box around the detected sign and calculate the centroid.

    Control Logic:
        Calculate the error between the centroid of the sign and the center of the frame.
        Generate control signals proportional to the errors.
        Print control signals to simulate robot navigation.

Next Steps:

    Advanced Detection:
        For more complex signs, consider using feature matching with ORB, SIFT, or machine learning models.

    Path Planning:
        Implement path planning algorithms if obstacles are present between the robot and the sign.

    Integration with Robot:
        Replace the print statements with actual commands to control the robot's motors.

By following these steps, you can create a system where the robot navigates to a specific location based on visual signs or markers.
